# Rigged Bingo Gender Reveal App

## Project Overview
A rigged bingo game for a gender reveal party where Girl Card 1 is guaranteed to win, revealing "IT'S A GIRL!" Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for browser display on TV.

## Working Configuration
- **Girl Card 1 wins with top row:** B5, I16, N31, G46, O61
- **Rigged sequence** that prevents wrong card wins while creating excitement
- **Cards are carefully designed** to avoid conflicts with the rigged sequence
- **Ultra-safe strategy:** Wrong cards get maximum 2 numbers from any winning pattern
- **Enhanced excitement:** Girl Card 1 gets 13 numbers total, Boy Card 2 gets 12 numbers total

## File Structure
- `index.html`: Main app structure with casino-style layout
- `styles.css`: Beautiful casino visuals with gold/gradient theme matching reference design
- `script.js`: Game logic with hardcoded rigged sequence and win-checking

## Usage Instructions
- **Main view:** Open `index.html` in browser
- **Dev mode:** Open `index.html?dev=true` (shows all 4 cards for verification)
- **Print mode:** Open `index.html?print=true` (printer-friendly cards for guests)

## Key Features
- **Rigged sequence:** Around 30 carefully chosen numbers that look random but guarantee Girl Card 1 wins
- **Win-checking:** Prevents accidental wrong card wins through careful number selection
- **Enhanced excitement:** Additional numbers for Girl Card 1 and Boy Card 2 to keep players engaged
- **Casino aesthetics:** TV-friendly display with professional bingo hall appearance
- **Dev mode:** Verify rigging works correctly by watching all cards get marked
- **Print cards:** Generate 4 cards (2 boy, 2 girl) for distribution to guests

## Card Distribution Strategy
- **Boy Card 1 & 2:** Give to guests you want to "lose"
- **Girl Card 1:** The guaranteed winner (give to someone you want to announce)
- **Girl Card 2:** Safe backup option (gets close but can't win)

## Technical Implementation
- **Hardcoded bingo cards:** Each card has specific numbers to avoid conflicts
- **Rigged sequence:** Numbers chosen to give excitement without wrong wins
- **Dynamic UI:** Modern casino-style interface with animations and effects
- **Responsive design:** Works on desktop and TV displays

## Sequence Safety Strategy
The breakthrough solution uses an "ultra-safe sequence strategy":
1. Wrong cards get maximum 2 numbers from any row/column/diagonal
2. Girl Card 1's winning numbers are interspersed throughout sequence
3. Additional Girl Card 1 and Boy Card 2 numbers create excitement without risk
4. Around 30 total numbers provides extended, engaging game pacing
5. All added numbers are completely safe (don't appear on other cards)

## Color Scheme & Style
- **Background:** Deep blue gradients (casino night theme)
- **Accents:** Gold borders and highlights
- **Numbers:** Gray with orange highlights when called
- **Current ball:** Red circular display with gold border
- **Animations:** Smooth transitions and celebration effects
