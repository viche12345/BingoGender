My wife and I are both software engineers, and she's pregnant! So, we'd like to celebrate a nerdy gender reveal with our family with a "rigged" bingo game, where we pass out "boy" or "girl" bingo cards to each person, and one girl card will always win (since we're expecting a daughter). Write us a Bingo app to run on a local browser that will act as the caller, picking and announcing numbers seemingly at random. 

Additional behavioral requirements: There will be 4 cards, 2 boy and 2 girl. The cards can be hardcoded. The "rigged" number sequence can also be hardcoded, but triple check, with utmost importance, to make sure not to let the wrong card win. The size of this rigged sequence should be large enough to make a close game for non-winning cards, and the winning sequence doesn't all have to be appended at the end of the pick sequence.

In terms of UI requirements, I'd like the main view to show the Bingo master board, like those broadcasted in a casino, with a button to draw a number. This UI will be shown on a TV during our celebration, so make it look visually appealing, like the UI on this page: https://timtree.github.io/bingo-master-board/. Secondly, allow a "dev mode" maybe via a URL parameter that allows us to see all the boards and their numbers picked to verify functionality. And then finally, give us the ability to make printer-friendly versions of each card, one per page, so that we can distribute them to our guests.
